/**
 * <i>benchmark proposed by Michel Lemaitre.</i>
 * <h4>The U2 problem</h4>
 *
 *"U2" has a Christmas concert that starts in 17 minutes and they must
 * all cross a bridge to get there.  All four men begin on the same side
 * of the bridge.  You must help them across to the other side. It is
 * night. There is one flashlight.  A maximum of two people can cross at
 * one time.  Any party who crosses, either 1 or 2 people, must have the
 * flashlight with them.  The flashlight must be walked back and forth,
 * it cannot be thrown, etc.  Each band member walks at a different
 * speed.  A pair must walk together at the rate of the slower man's
 * pace:
 *
 *           <ul>
 *           <li> Bono:- 1 minute to cross
 *           <li> Edge:- 2 minutes to cross
 *           <li> Adam:- 5 minutes to cross
 *           <li> Larry:-10 minutes to cross
 *           </ul>
 *
 * For example: if Bono and Larry walk across first, 10 minutes have
 * elapsed when they get to the other side of the bridge.  If Larry then
 * returns with the flashlight, a total of 20 minutes have passed and you
 * have failed the mission.  Notes: There is no trick behind this.  It is
 * the simple movement of resources in the appropriate order.  There are
 * two known answers to this problem.  This is based on a question
 * Microsoft gives to all prospective employees.  <br>
 * <i>Note</i>: Microsoft expects
 * you to answer this question in under 5 minutes!  Good Luck!  REMEMBER
 * - all the parameters you need to solve the problem are given to you!
 * That means all 4 guys ARE AT THE OTHER SIDE in 17 minutes. 2 guys at a
 * time MAX on the bridge at any time AND they HAVE to have the ONE
 * flashlight with them.
