 *    Choco is a java library for constraint     *
 *    satisfaction problems (CSP), constraint    *
 *    programming (CP) and explanation-based     *
 *    constraint solving (e-CP). It is built     *
 *    on a event-based propagation mechanism     *
 *    with backtrackable structures.             *
